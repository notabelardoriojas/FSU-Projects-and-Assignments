>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, tolerance=1e-07
