ABELARDO RIOJAS PCA LAB README

SUP WELCOME TO THE COOLEST PCA LAB README EVER

YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN EVERYTHING FINE IF YOUR SUBJECT FOLDERS ARE SAVED UNDER A FOLDER CALLED 'ARCHIVE'

RUNNING PCA.M IN MATLAB WILL GENERATE ALL THE FIGURES IN YOUR MATLAB DIRECTORY.

IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE FIGURES GENERATED BY THE SECOND DATA SET, UNCOMMENT EVERYTHING COMMENTED OUT AS 'Second data set'

OTHER THAN THAT, IT SHOULD WORK.

HAVE FUN,
ABELARDO
