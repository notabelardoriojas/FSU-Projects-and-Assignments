My project would use space-filling curves (specifically the Hilbert Curve) to see if people can "hear" a picture. It would take a color image and use RBG values to generate a sound. Red values would generate a square waveform with the R value being a scalar for the pitch of the sound. Blue values would generate triangular waveforms, and Green values would generate a sawtooth waveform. After going through each pixel (hilbert's curve ensures the pixels are close together) and generating a sound for each one, a sound for the entire picture can be made by overlapping the RBG waves together. One possible challenge could be dealing with the sound package, and the main deliverable would be the sound generated by the picture!
