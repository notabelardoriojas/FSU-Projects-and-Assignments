Explanation of my program: This program finds the roots of functins using the bisection, newtons, or seacant method

How to run my program:
step one: download the program and extract it somewhere
step two: open up terminal and cd to the directory that you extracted the program to
step three: compile the program by running the command g++ HW3.cpp -o HW3
step four: run the command with the ./HW3 command
step five: follow the instructions directed by the command line

step six (optional) : if you want to change the function you're going to have to change the f and fp functions to return your function

How this homework made me feel:

You can see clearly that I found a more elegant way to do the program the more time I spent on it! That's a good sign I guess! I'm not making as many syntax mistakes anymore and I'm learning to program more iteratively so I can find my mistakes easier too. I don't think it's perfect, I could have made the bisection algoritm check if a and c are valid bisection inputs to change a to b or b to c. But, who needs perfect when you have good enough!
I really hope your functions work on this thing by the way.

This is my shamless attempt to earn extra points for an enjoyable readme:
"Why didn't the skeleton cross the road?"
"Because he didn't have the guts to do it!"
