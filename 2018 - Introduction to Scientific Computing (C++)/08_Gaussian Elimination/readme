Explanation of my program: This program verifies that the functions under class myMath are functioning.

How to run my program:
step one: download the program and extract it somewhere
	step one.one(optional) make sure the datafile you want to read from is in the same directory as the cpp file.
step two: open up terminal and cd to the directory that you extracted the program to
step three: compile the program by running the command g++ -std=c++11 HW7.cpp -o HW7
step four: run the command with the ./HW7 command
step five: follow the instructions directed by the command line, you might have to run the program a few times

step six (optional) : if you want to change the function you're going to have to change the f function to return your function


SHAMLESS JOKE TIME:

A manager, a mechanical engineer, and computational scientist are driving back from convention through the mountains. Suddenly, as they crest a hill, the brakes on the car go out and they fly careening down the mountain. After scraping against numerous guardrails, they come to a stop in the ditch. Everyone gets out of the car to assess the damage.

The manager says, "Let's form a group to collaborate ideas on how we can solve this issue."

The mechanical engineer suggests, "We should disassemble the car and analyze each part for failure."

The computational scientist says, "Let's push it back up the hill and see if it does it again."
