Professor Shaw,

I hope you like spaghetti, because I definitely wrote some of the finest spaghetti code for question 2.

Question one is pretty simple, it prints out the message given in the question in the same syntax as the example given in the lecture.

Question two, however, tripped me up a bit. I think there's an easier way to do this. I'm not even sure if it's going to work when I compile it in class tomorrow. I probably made too many ints. Also I wasn't sure how to print an interger, either. Google turns out to be a resource that gives diminishing returns once your questions get more and more specific!

I look forward to going over this in class.

I knew I made too many ints! Maybe it's a gut feeling that comes when you realize you want to be a computational scientist or something.
