//Homework 1 readme

Okay Professor, I really hope this program is going to work!

I read up on some tutorials in C++ from Cplusplus.com and they seem to use a different library than we have been using in class (iostream instead of stdio.h) and so this program is slightly different than the ones we went over in class.
Hopefully I understood what I was reading because I'm probably going to compile this code for the first time when we enter class tomorrow afternoon.
Speaking of complilers, I'm trying to get EMACS on my computer so I can do homework more efficiently. I have some experience working with virtual machines from my last job (IT support) and tried setting up a linux machine that could run EMACs for me, but I can't seem to get it to install through the command line. 
Would this be something that I could come to you during office hours for?

Anyways, back to the program.

Question 1
I used the cin and cout streams to ask the user for their name and then display it on the screen. Pretty simple. The only part that tripped me up was the diference in the arrows for cin and cout (>> and <<, respectively) You would think the arrows for cin would point INto the word cin and the arrows for cout would point OUTwards from cout, but I digress.

Question 2
This is one that I ended up having to be a little creative with. I put in checks for when the user doesn't input a positive interger and a non interger! I tried to make a function to ask the user to input the number to be summed in if else conditionals within int main. Have you ever been stuck on a problem and fallen asleep only to figure out the answer the first time you tried it the following morning? That was me with this exercise. 
Let's hope it works.

Question 3
The password is, very uninspiringly, password.
ADAM HELPED ME A LOT.
