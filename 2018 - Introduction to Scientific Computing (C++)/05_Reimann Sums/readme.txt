Explanation of my program: This program uses Riemann summs to find the area under curves given hardcoded a and b values

How to run my program:
step one: download the program and extract it somewhere
step two: open up terminal and cd to the directory that you extracted the program to
step three: compile the program by running the command g++ HW4.cpp -o HW4
step four: run the command with the ./HW4 command
step five: follow the instructions directed by the command line

step six (optional) : if you want to change the function you're going to have to change the f function to return your function

How this homework made me feel:

In a word: overthinking! Once you showed me how I was supposed to do this homework, I lost it! I'm glad a gave this homework a shot without googling how to do it, even though I ended up with wrong answers for functions with asymtotes. Oh well.

Here's a another shameless attempt to get a point on my homework assignment, my friend Erin told me this joke.

"Where do cows go on a first date?"

"To the mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon"
