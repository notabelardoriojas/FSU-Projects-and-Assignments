Explanation of my program: This program verifies that the functions under class myMath are functioning.

How to run my program:
step one: download the program and extract it somewhere
step two: open up terminal and cd to the directory that you extracted the program to
step three: compile the program by running the command g++ -std=c++11 HW5.cpp -o HW5
step four: run the command with the ./HW5 command
step five: follow the instructions directed by the command line, you might have to run the program a few times

step six (optional) : if you want to change the function you're going to have to change the f function to return your function

How this homework made me feel:
I spent a lot of time adapting my functions to work with private variables from a class. This makes me think there's a pseudostandard way to write methods in classes. I think I figured what that was.

AS FOR THE MONTECARLO METHOD, I really want the monte carlo method that I wrote to work :(, do you think I could see you about getting it to work just for fun sometime? 
I included the method that retrives the wrong answer for partial extra credit, (if that's cool)

SHAMLESS JOKE TIME:

Why do people never see the hippos that hide behind the tress in Landis green?

Because they're really, really good at it.
